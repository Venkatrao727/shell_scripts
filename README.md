shell_scripts
=============
testAPI.sh and RunFlow.sh are the only shell scripts available in this repo. 
testAPI.sh is a helper file which checks if the service is up and response is proper provided the request is sent correctly.
RunFlow.sh simulates a user flow/activity. That is, if user is using an app, user can randomly select a store and from 
each store he can browse for deals and he may select a particular deal and redeem it, share it etc. 
All the mentioned activities are simulated using shell script.
